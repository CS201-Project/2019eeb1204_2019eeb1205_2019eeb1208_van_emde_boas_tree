# Van Emde Boas Tree (CS201 group project)
This repository is the implementation of Van Emde Boas Tree (or simply, VEB Tree) by our group as the course project of the course CS201 (Data Structures). The objective of this project was to understand and implement the VEB Tree. This was further extended to its comparison with other data structures like AVL Trees, B-Trees etc. It was expected and observed that this data structure has lesser time complexity than those data structures. However, in  some cases the space complexity is more in VEB Trees as compared to other data structures. Numerous studies and articles are cited in relation to this data structure. They were understood, implemented and desired results were obtained.
